> [!WARNING]
> **WORK IN PROGRESS:** This project is currently under active development and should be considered experimental. It will be officially released as soon as it is stable.

This repository contains a set of custom nodes for ComfyUI that provide a wrapper for Microsoft's **RenderFormer** model. It allows you to render complex 3D scenes with physically-based materials and global illumination directly within the ComfyUI interface.

### üå± My Journey

This project represents my very first baby steps into the world of coding and my first-ever contribution to the open-source community. ‚ù§Ô∏è It was born out of a desire to learn and create, fueled by late-night sessions of what can only be described as "vibecoding."

What started as a simple experiment quickly grew into a passion project. It has been a journey of discovery, filled with challenges, learning, and the immense satisfaction of seeing an idea come to life. I hope this wrapper brings as much utility and fun to your projects as it has brought me in building it. Thank you for being a part of my story!

### Version 0.2 - Refinements and Fixes

This version focuses on improving the usability and stability of the nodes, with several key refinements and bug fixes.

**Key Features & Accomplishments:**

*   **Material Output:** The `LoadMesh` node now has a `RENDERFORMER_MATERIAL` output, allowing you to pipe the material from one mesh to another.
*   **Default Transformations:** When loading specific background meshes from the `cbox-bunny.json` example (`plane.obj`, `wall0.obj`, `wall1.obj`, `wall2.obj`), the node now automatically applies the correct transformation values.
*   **Increased Precision:** The precision for rotation and scale inputs has been increased for finer control over transformations.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved an out-of-memory error that could occur with high-resolution rendering or complex scenes.

### Version 0.1 - Initial Development

This initial version of the PHRenderFormerWrapper lays the foundation for rendering 3D scenes within ComfyUI. The focus was on establishing the core architecture, implementing a comprehensive set of nodes for scene construction, and creating a flexible, user-friendly workflow.

**Key Features & Accomplishments:**

*   **Core Rendering Pipeline:**
    *   `RenderFormerModelLoader`: Loads the RenderFormer model from Hugging Face.
    *   `RenderFormerGenerator`: The main sampler node that renders the final image from a scene.
    *   **In-Memory Scene Processing:** The entire scene-to-HDF5 conversion process is handled in memory, patching `trimesh` and `h5py` to avoid slow disk operations and temporary files. This is a key performance and efficiency feature.

*   **Modular Scene Construction:**
    *   `LoadMesh`: Loads `.obj`, `.glb`, and other 3D files. Also acts as the central point for defining PBR materials.
    *   `RenderFormerCamera`: Defines camera position, target, and FOV.
    *   `RenderFormerLighting`: Creates an emissive light source with configurable properties.
    *   `RenderFormerSceneBuilder`: Assembles all components (meshes, materials, camera, lights) into a final scene ready for rendering.

*   **Advanced Node Functionality:**
    *   `RenderFormerMeshCombine`: Allows for combining multiple `PH_MESH` objects into a single scene.
    *   `RenderFormerLightingCombine`: Allows for combining multiple light sources.
    *   `RemeshMesh`: Simplifies mesh geometry to a target face count using `pymeshlab`.
    *   `RandomizeColors`: A utility node to apply a deterministic, gradient-based color pattern to a mesh's faces, useful for debugging and creative effects.
    *   `RenderFormerFromJSON` & `LoadRenderFormerExampleScene`: Provides advanced methods for loading scenes directly from JSON definitions or the original RenderFormer example files.

*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   **File Uploader:** The `LoadMesh` node includes a convenient "choose mesh to upload" button.
    *   **Advanced Color Picker:** The `diffuse_rgb` string input was replaced with a custom, canvas-based interactive color picker for a much better user experience.
    *   **High-Precision Transforms:** All transform inputs (translation, rotation, scale) were given high precision for fine-grained control.

### üöÄ Features

-   **üé® End-to-End Rendering:** Load 3D models, define materials, set up cameras, and render‚Äîall within ComfyUI.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Modular Node-Based Workflow:** Each step of the rendering pipeline is a separate node, allowing for flexible and complex setups.
-   **üîß Advanced Mesh Processing:** Includes nodes for loading, combining, remeshing, and applying simple color randomization to your 3D assets.
-   **üí° Lighting and Material Control:** Easily add default light sources and control PBR material properties like diffuse, specular, roughness, and emission.
-   **‚ÜîÔ∏è Full Transformation Control:** Apply translation, rotation, and scaling to objects within the scene.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> ComfyUI_PHRenderFormerWrapper
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI_PHRenderFormerWrapper
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Restart ComfyUI.

### üì¶ Nodes

-   **PHRenderFormer Model Loader**: Loads a specified RenderFormer model from Hugging Face or a local path.
-   **PHRenderFormer Mesh Loader**: Loads a 3D mesh file (e.g., `.obj`, `.glb`). Includes a file upload button to add models directly to your `ComfyUI/input/3d` directory.
-   **PHRenderFormer Mesh Combine**: Combines multiple meshes into a single scene object.
-   **PHRenderFormer Remesh**: Simplifies the geometry of a mesh to a target face count using `pymeshlab`.
-   **PHRenderFormer Random Colors**: Applies random vertex colors to a mesh for creative effects.
-   **PHRenderFormer Camera**: Defines the camera's position, look-at target, and field of view (FOV).
-   **PHRenderFormer Material**: Defines the PBR material properties for a mesh. The diffuse color can be set using an interactive, canvas-based color picker within the `PHRenderFormer Mesh Loader` node.
-   **PHRenderFormer Lighting**: Controls the scene's lighting, allowing you to add and configure a default emissive light source.
-   **PHRenderFormer Scene Builder**: Assembles the final scene by combining meshes, a camera, materials, lighting, and transformations.
-   **PHRenderFormer Sampler**: Executes the RenderFormer pipeline on the assembled scene to produce the final rendered image.
-   **PHRenderFormer From JSON**: Loads a scene from a JSON definition, allowing for more complex and customized setups.
