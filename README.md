This repository contains a set of custom nodes for ComfyUI that provide a wrapper for Microsoft's **RenderFormer** model. It allows you to render complex 3D scenes (see **Limits**) with physically-based materials and global illumination directly within the ComfyUI interface.



> [!WARNING]
> **WORK IN PROGRESS & HELLO WORLD:** This project is my first "hello world" in contributing code of any kind and is currently under active development. It should be considered experimental. The model is in a very early stage and may be further developed later. I do not take responsibility if this breaks anything and do not plan to provide official support for it.

### 💡 Usage

This node pack follows a standard 3D rendering pipeline. The basic workflow, as seen in the `ph_renderformer_basic_01.json` example, can be broken down into the following steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Step 1: Load Model"
        A["RenderFormer Model Loader"]
    end

    subgraph "Step 2: Define Scene Elements"
        B["RenderFormer Mesh Loader"] --> C["RenderFormer Random Colors"]
        D["RenderFormer Camera"]
        E["RenderFormer Lighting"]
    end

    subgraph "Step 3: Build Scene"
        C --> F["RenderFormer Scene Builder"]
        D --> F
        E --> F
    end

    subgraph "Step 4: Render (Sample)"
        A --> G["RenderFormer Sampler"]
        F --> G
    end

    subgraph "Step 5: Save Output"
        G --> H["Save Image"]
    end

    style A fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style B fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style C fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style D fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style E fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style F fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style G fill:#FDC501,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
    style H fill:#a0a0a0,stroke:#111417,stroke-width:2px,color:#111417
```

1.  **Load Model**: Start by loading the `RenderFormer Model Loader`. This node downloads the specified model from Hugging Face and prepares it for the pipeline.
2.  **Define Scene Elements**:
    *   **Mesh**: Use the `RenderFormer Mesh Loader` to load your 3D model (e.g., an `.obj` file). Here, you can also set its transformation (translation, rotation, scale) and define its core material properties. In the example, the output is passed to `RenderFormer Random Colors` for a creative effect.
    *   **Camera**: Add a `RenderFormer Camera` to define the viewpoint, target, and field of view.
    *   **Lighting**: Use the `RenderFormer Lighting` node to create one or more light sources. You can combine multiple lights with the `RenderFormer Lighting Combine` node.
3.  **Build Scene**: Connect the `MESH`, `CAMERA`, and `LIGHTING` outputs into the `RenderFormer Scene Builder`. This node collects all the components and assembles the final scene data that the model will render. You can also choose to add a default background plane and walls here.
4.  **Render (Sample)**: The `RenderFormer Sampler` takes the `MODEL` and the `SCENE` as input. It performs the actual rendering operation and outputs the final image.
5.  **Save Output**: Connect the `IMAGE` output from the sampler to a `Save Image` node to save the result.

For video, the workflow is similar. You would use a `RenderFormer Camera Target` to create a `CAMERA_SEQUENCE`, which then goes into the `RenderFormer Scene Builder`. The `RenderFormer Sampler` will automatically detect the sequence and output an image batch (`IMAGES`) ready for a video-saving node.

### 🚀 Advanced Usage: Building Complex Scenes & Multi-Light Animations

For more complex projects, you can combine multiple meshes and create sophisticated camera and lighting animations. The `ph_renderformer_advanced_01.json` workflow demonstrates this by building a scene with several object groups and animating multiple lights simultaneously.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Step 1: Load Model"
        A["RenderFormer Model Loader"]
    end

    subgraph "Step 2: Define Scene Elements"
        subgraph "Compose Meshes"
            B1["Mesh Group 1 (e.g., Characters)"] --> C1["Mesh Combine 1"]
            B2["Mesh Group 2 (e.g., Environment)"] --> C2["Mesh Combine 2"]
            C1 --> C3["Final Mesh Combine"]
            C2 --> C3
        end

        subgraph "Animate Camera"
            D1["RenderFormer Camera (Start)"] --> D2["RenderFormer Camera Target (End)"]
        end
        
        subgraph "Animate Multiple Lights"
            L1_Start["Light 1 (Start)"] --> L1_Target["Light 1 Target"]
            L2_Start["Light 2 (Start)"] --> L2_Target["Light 2 Target"]
            L1_Target --> LC["Lighting Combine"]
            L2_Target --> LC
        end
    end

    subgraph "Step 3: Build Scene Sequence"
        A --> F["RenderFormer Scene Builder"]
        C3 -- MESH --> F
        D1 -- required CAMERA --> F
        D2 -- optional CAMERA_SEQUENCE --> F
        LC -- LIGHTING & LIGHTING_SEQUENCE --> F
    end

    subgraph "Step 4: Render (Sample)"
        F -- SCENE_SEQUENCE --> G["RenderFormer Sampler"]
    end

    subgraph "Step 5: Create & Save Video"
        G -- IMAGES --> H["Create Video"]
        H --> I["Save Video"]
    end

```

1.  **Compose Your Scene**: Build complex scenes by loading multiple `RenderFormer Mesh Loader` nodes. Group them logically using `RenderFormer Mesh Combine` nodes. You can even chain `Combine` nodes together for highly organized, large-scale scenes.
2.  **Animate the Camera**: Define the starting view with a `RenderFormer Camera` node and the ending view with a `RenderFormer Camera Target` node.
3.  **Animate Multiple Lights**:
    *   For each light you want to animate, create a pair of `RenderFormer Lighting` (for the start state) and `RenderFormer Lighting Target` (for the end state) nodes.
    *   Feed all the `Lighting Target` outputs into a single `RenderFormer Lighting Combine` node. This node intelligently gathers all start and end states.
4.  **Build the Scene Sequence**:
    *   Connect your final combined `MESH` to the `RenderFormer Scene Builder`.
    *   Connect your starting `RenderFormer Camera` to the required `camera` input.
    *   Connect your `RenderFormer Camera Target` to the optional `camera_sequence` input.
    *   The `RenderFormer Lighting Combine` node provides two outputs. Connect its `LIGHTING` output to the required `lighting` input of the Scene Builder, and its `LIGHTING_SEQUENCE` output to the optional `lighting_sequence` input.
5.  **Render and Save**: The `RenderFormer Sampler` will receive the `SCENE_SEQUENCE` and render all frames, which can then be saved as a video.

### 📦 Nodes

This wrapper provides a comprehensive set of nodes to build 3D scenes.

#### Core Pipeline
-   **RenderFormer Model Loader**: Loads a specified RenderFormer model from Hugging Face or a local path.
-   **RenderFormer Scene Builder**: Assembles a scene from meshes, lighting, and camera inputs. It can handle both single camera inputs for static images and camera sequences for creating animations.
-   **RenderFormer Sampler**: Executes the RenderFormer pipeline on a scene or a sequence of scenes. It intelligently handles both single images and image batches for video, producing the final rendered output.

#### Scene Components
-   **RenderFormer Mesh Loader**: Loads a 3D mesh file (e.g., `.obj`, `.glb`). This node is also used to define an object's material properties and transformations.
-   **RenderFormer Camera**: Defines the camera's position, look-at target, and field of view (FOV).
-   **RenderFormer Lighting**: Creates a configurable emissive light source.

#### Animation
-   **RenderFormer Camera Target**: Creates a camera animation sequence by defining a start and end camera state (position, look-at, FOV).
-   **RenderFormer Lighting Target**: Creates a light animation sequence by defining a start and end light state (position, rotation, scale, and emission).

#### Utilities
-   **RenderFormer Mesh Combine**: Combines multiple `MESH` outputs into a single object list.
-   **RenderFormer Lighting Combine**: A powerful node that enables multi-light animation. It accepts any combination of static lights (`LIGHTING`) and animated lights (`LIGHTING_SEQUENCE`), and outputs a single, unified `LIGHTING_SEQUENCE` ready for the Scene Builder. It also outputs the `start_frame_lighting` separately for a direct, convenient connection.
-   **RenderFormer Remesh**: Simplifies the geometry of a mesh to a target face count using `pymeshlab`.
-   **RenderFormer Random Colors**: Applies random vertex colors to a mesh for creative effects or debugging.

#### Advanced & Experimental
-   **RenderFormer From JSON**: Loads a scene from a JSON definition, allowing for more complex and customized setups based on the original RenderFormer format.
-   **RenderFormer Example Scene**: A test node to quickly load one of the official RenderFormer example scenes.

### 📜 Version History

#### Version 0.5.0 - Workflow Optimization
-   **Workflow:** The animation workflow has been significantly simplified and made more robust. The `RenderFormerSceneBuilder` now has a **required** `lighting` input that explicitly defines the start-frame lighting.
-   **Workflow:** The `end_lighting` input on the `Scene Builder` has been **removed**. All lighting animation is now handled by the optional `lighting_sequence` input, which provides the end-frame state.
-   **Data Flow:** The `RenderFormerLightingTarget` and `RenderFormerLightingCombine` nodes have been updated to output a standardized `LIGHTING_SEQUENCE` dictionary (`{ "start_lights": [...], "end_lights": [...] }`), ensuring consistent data flow.
-   **Convenience:** The `RenderFormerLightingCombine` node now provides a separate `start_frame_lighting` output for a direct connection to the `Scene Builder`'s required `lighting` input, preserving a clean and logical graph.

#### Version 0.3.0 - Animation Overhaul and Performance Boost
-   **Feature: Full Light Animation:** The `RenderFormerLightingTarget` node now supports animating a light's position, rotation, scale, and emissive strength, enabling complex dynamic lighting effects.
-   **Fix: Animation Transformation:** Reworked the animation pipeline to correctly interpolate object and light transformations, ensuring smooth movement, rotation, and scaling.
-   **Performance: In-Memory Scene Generation:** The entire scene-building process now runs in-memory, dramatically reducing processing time by avoiding disk I/O for intermediate files.
-   **Workflow:** The `RenderFormer Sampler` and `Scene Builder` nodes now handle both static scenes and animation sequences more robustly.

#### Version 0.2.5 - Node Consolidation and Workflow Simplification
-   **Workflow:** Merged the `RenderFormerVideoSamplerBatched` into the main `RenderFormerGenerator` (now `RenderFormer Sampler`). The sampler now intelligently handles both single images and video sequences, with an optional `IMAGES` output.
-   **Workflow:** Merged the `RenderFormerVideoSceneBuilder` into the main `RenderFormerSceneBuilder`. The node now accepts both a single `CAMERA` and a `CAMERA_SEQUENCE`, with optional `SCENE` and `SCENE_SEQUENCE` outputs.
-   **Fix:** Resolved a critical `AttributeError` in the `RenderFormerSceneBuilder` caused by a missing helper method after the node merge.
-   **Fix:** Removed hardcoded material properties for background meshes in the `RenderFormerLoadMesh` node, ensuring that materials are always controlled by the node's inputs.
-   **UI/UX:** Added a colored startup message with an ASCII logo to provide clear feedback on whether the nodes loaded successfully.
-   **UI/UX:** Fixed a `SyntaxWarning` related to escape sequences in the startup message.

#### Version 0.2.21 Beta Test - UI/UX and Workflow Enhancements
-   **Examples:** added example workflows for ComfyUI.
-   **UI/UX:** All nodes now have custom colors for better visual organization in the graph. The header is yellow (`#FDC501`) and the body is anthracite (`#111417`).
-   **UI/UX:** Added progress bars to all long-running nodes (`SceneBuilder`, `VideoSceneBuilder`, `Sampler`, `VideoSampler`, `Remesh`) to provide real-time feedback.
-   **Workflow:** The `Remesh` node now processes all meshes in a list, not just the first one.
-   **Workflow:** The `SceneBuilder` nodes will no longer add the default background if a background mesh has already been loaded manually, preventing duplicates.
-   **Input Precision:** The `emissive_strength` input on the `Lighting` node now has a smaller step value for finer control.

#### Version 0.1.9 - Video Rendering and Stability
