This repository contains a set of custom nodes for ComfyUI that provide a wrapper for Microsoft's **RenderFormer** model. It allows you to render complex 3D scenes with physically-based materials and global illumination directly within the ComfyUI interface.

> [!WARNING]
> **WORK IN PROGRESS & HELLO WORLD:** This project is my first "hello world" in contributing code of any kind and is currently under active development. It should be considered experimental. I do not take responsibility if this breaks anything and do not plan to provide official support for it.

### üöÄ Features

-   **üé® End-to-End Rendering:** Load 3D models, define materials, set up cameras, and render‚Äîall within ComfyUI.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Modular Node-Based Workflow:** Each step of the rendering pipeline is a separate node, allowing for flexible and complex setups.
-   **üé• Animation & Video:** Create camera animations by interpolating between keyframes. The nodes output image batches compatible with ComfyUI's native video-saving nodes.
-   **üîß Advanced Mesh Processing:** Includes nodes for loading, combining, remeshing, and applying simple color randomization to your 3D assets.
-   **üí° Lighting and Material Control:** Easily add and combine multiple light sources and control PBR material properties like diffuse, specular, roughness, and emission.
-   **‚ÜîÔ∏è Full Transformation Control:** Apply translation, rotation, and scaling to objects within the scene.
-   **‚ö° In-Memory Processing:** The entire scene preparation pipeline, from loading meshes to generating the final HDF5 data for the model, is handled in-memory to maximize speed and avoid disk I/O.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

#### Prerequisites

-   **Git:** Required for cloning the repository and installing certain dependencies.
-   **Python:** A Python version compatible with ComfyUI and PyTorch 2.0+.
-   **PyTorch:** A compatible version of PyTorch must be installed for your hardware (NVIDIA CUDA or Apple Metal). This wrapper is tested with PyTorch 2.7.1 and CUDA 12.6.
-   **ComfyUI:** A working installation of ComfyUI.

#### Installation Steps

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/ComfyUI_PHRenderFormerWrapper.git
    ```
3.  Navigate into the newly cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI_PHRenderFormerWrapper
    ```
4.  Clone the official Microsoft RenderFormer repository into this directory. It **must** be named `renderformer`:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/renderformer.git renderformer
    ```
5.  Install the required Python packages for this wrapper:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6.  RenderFormer requires an additional plugin for handling HDR image formats. Run the following command to download it:
    ```bash
    python -c "import imageio; imageio.plugins.freeimage.download()"
    ```
7.  Restart ComfyUI.

> [!NOTE]
> For NVIDIA GPU users, the underlying RenderFormer library can optionally use **Flash Attention** for better performance. If you have it installed in your PyTorch environment, it should be used automatically.

### üì¶ Nodes

This wrapper provides a comprehensive set of nodes to build 3D scenes.

#### Core Pipeline
-   **PHRenderFormer Model Loader**: Loads a specified RenderFormer model from Hugging Face or a local path.
-   **PHRenderFormer Scene Builder**: Assembles a final scene for single-image rendering from meshes, a camera, materials, and lighting.
-   **PHRenderFormer Sampler**: Executes the RenderFormer pipeline on an assembled scene to produce the final rendered image.

#### Video & Animation
-   **PHRenderFormer Camera Target**: Creates a camera animation sequence by interpolating between a start and end camera state (position, look-at, FOV).
-   **PHRenderFormer Video Scene Builder**: Assembles a sequence of scenes, one for each frame of a camera animation.
-   **PHRenderFormer Video Sampler**: Renders a sequence of scenes and outputs the frames as an image batch, ready to be connected to a "Save Video" node.

#### Scene Components
-   **PHRenderFormer Mesh Loader**: Loads a 3D mesh file (e.g., `.obj`, `.glb`). Includes a file upload button and serves as the primary node for defining an object's material and transformation.
-   **PHRenderFormer Camera**: Defines the camera's position, look-at target, and field of view (FOV).
-   **PHRenderFormer Material**: Defines the PBR material properties for a mesh. The diffuse color can be set using an interactive, canvas-based color picker.
-   **PHRenderFormer Lighting**: Creates a configurable emissive light source.

#### Utilities & Advanced
-   **PHRenderFormer Mesh Combine**: Combines multiple `PH_MESH` outputs into a single object list.
-   **PHRenderFormer Lighting Combine**: Combines multiple light sources into a single list for the scene builder.
-   **PHRenderFormer Remesh**: Simplifies the geometry of a mesh to a target face count using `pymeshlab`.
-   **PHRenderFormer Random Colors**: Applies random vertex colors to a mesh for creative effects or debugging.
-   **PHRenderFormer From JSON**: Loads a scene from a JSON definition, allowing for more complex and customized setups based on the original RenderFormer format.
-   **PHRenderFormer Example Scene**: A test node to quickly load one of the official RenderFormer example scenes.

### Version History

#### Version 0.3 - Video Rendering and Stability
-   **Feature:** Added a complete, dedicated workflow for video rendering (`Camera Target`, `Video Scene Builder`, `Video Sampler`).
-   **Fix:** Resolved a `dacite.exceptions.MissingValueError` in the video scene builder.
-   **Fix:** Addressed `TypeError` and `FileNotFoundError` bugs related to temporary file handling in the video pipeline.
-   **Change:** Separated single-image and video workflows for improved stability and clarity.

#### Version 0.2 - Refinements and Fixes
-   **Feature:** The `LoadMesh` node now has a `RENDERFORMER_MATERIAL` output, allowing material properties to be shared.
-   **Feature:** Added default transformations for specific background meshes from the official examples.
-   **Change:** Increased input precision for rotation and scale transformations.

#### Version 0.1 - Initial Development
-   **Feature:** Established the core rendering pipeline and all essential nodes for building and rendering a static 3D scene.
-   **Feature:** Implemented in-memory scene processing to patch `trimesh` and `h5py`, avoiding slow disk I/O.
-   **Feature:** Added advanced utility nodes like `RemeshMesh`, `RandomizeColors`, and `FromJSON`.
-   **UI/UX:** Integrated a file uploader and a custom canvas-based color picker for a better user experience.

### üå± My Journey

This project represents my first steps into coding and open-source contribution. It was born out of a desire to learn and create. What started as a simple experiment has been a journey of discovery, and I'm excited to see where it goes. I would love to develop this project further with the help of the community and welcome any contributions or feedback.
